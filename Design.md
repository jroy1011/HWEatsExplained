**NON-CAFETERIA STAFF SIDE:** 


**Idea**: Website called HW Eats that allows students and faculty to order what they want from the cafeteria ahead and pick up that food day of. 


**Analogy**: If you have ever ordered pick-up for a Starbuck’s order or any restaurant order … this is essentially the same thing but for HW’s cafeteria 


**How it works:** Go to HW Eats website (hweats.hw.com), log in using your HW account, click “Order Now”, choose where you want to order from (Sandwich Bar or Hot Bar), make your order, click “Check out”, choose time slot (they are in 15 minute intervals), and place order. You can only order the day before and you pay once you pick up your food (may change this).  


**HW Eat’s impact:** The website will reduce lunch lines and the amount of time students and faculty spend their lunch waiting to get food. Also may encourage more people to actually get lunch because there will be less of a wait. 


**Communication plan:** Through Video. *Video only documents non-cafeteria staff side*


**Rules for non-cafeteria staff users:** 1) Have to order the day before 2) have to be one of the first 20 people to order in that time slot, maximum of 80 pre-orders each lunch (20 people for each 4 time slots) --> purpose of this rule is to prevent long lines for pickup

**CAFETERIA STAFF SIDE:** 


**Idea**:  Part of the website for Cafeteria staff where they can see the pick-up orders in an organized manner. 

**How it works:** 
1. On hweats.hw.com there is a tab called “Cafeteria Staff” this tab is only for staff in the Cafeteria. When this tab is clicked they will be asked to log in with their Cafeteria staff login 

  2. Once they log in they will see a page that says “Orders from Sandwich Bar” and “Orders from Hot Bar” (see image: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fe3a751-2b1e-4167-ab6b-a5c8c9b89d9c)

3. If staff member  clicks “Sandwich Bar” they will see 2 charts that look like this: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b54fce09-4399-42a9-989c-44dfcf383a87

          Purpose of Order table: organizes order by time slot in which they are going to be picked up. Each time a person comes and picks up their order, their name gets removed from the list. 

         	Purpose of Ingredients Table: States how many people wanted a certain ingredient. The person ordering the sandwich doesn’t get to say how much of that ingredient they want → that is up to the cafeteria staff to decide (this is how it works in-person I believe). 
		       → purpose of ingredients table is to help cafeteria staff determine how many ingredients they will need for these pickup-orders
	           → Ingredients table is organized so that the most requested ingredient in each category is in the first row

5. If staff member clicks “Hot Bar” they will see this: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40b63fc3-69ed-4dc8-8977-35e13f4760c2

    → Once person picks up their order their name is taken off the list

   →Chart is organized by what time slots orders are coming in 

    → if there are multiple of the same orders during the same time slot, they will all be listed consecutively before moving on to the next order. (see image)

**TOPICS FOR DISCUSSION:** 
- Where do people pick up their food?
- What happens if someone is late to pickup their food (aka supposed to pickup from 11:15 to 11:30 time slot but show up at 12:00 to 12:15 time slot)
- What if the person just doesn't show up to pick up their food?
- When should people pay for their order? In person or on the website?
